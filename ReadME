at CubePilot, we are all about collaboration, and in this Repo, I have invited all the registered carrier board developers.

I would like to increase the level of cooperation within this group, and to start with, we would like to do a CubePilot poster that shows all the various carrier boards that are in the community, and to promote your companies as part of this community.

If you have not seen CubePilot Ecosystem poster, please have a look at https://docs.cubepilot.org/user-guides/cubepilot-ecosystem/cubepilot-ecosystem-autopilot-wiring-diagram
we would like to do another poster that highlights as many carrier boards as possible.

we do understand that some of you don’t want to be public, that’s fine too.

if you are keen to be part of this, please contact me on discuss.cubepilot.org and we will be able to get started. 

Thanks!
